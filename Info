The Challenge

Planning a 36-month sailing circumnavigation connecting 13 French overseas territories across 45,000 nautical miles, three years before departure, requires reliable data to secure funding, build a crew, and ensure safety. Current tools (OpenCPN + Weather Routing and Climatology plugins) rely on general historical meteorological data that lacks the precision and integration needed for complex expedition planning
Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon requires precise timing due to North Atlantic weather patterns
